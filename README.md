## üìå Summary

This code implements key simulation results for:

- **Hybrid Blockwise Receiver**: Analog linear combiner + delay network
- **Adaptive Threshold Receiver**: Stream-wise one-bit ADCs with time-varying thresholds

The receivers are evaluated over single-user and multi-user MIMO settings.  
Both high-SNR approximations and finite-SNR numerical simulations are provided.
